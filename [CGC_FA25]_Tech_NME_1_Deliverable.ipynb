        "Linear programming can help make optimized decisions in sustainability projects. For instance, when planning food recovery events, composting drives, or energy reduction projects, LP can determine the best allocation of limited resources, like budget, volunteer time, or materials, to maximize environmental and social impact. For example, in regards to the map application we are currently building that visualizes how much food waste the community produces, LP could determine the optimal way to allocate such waste between composting, donation, or other recovery options, while considering factors like cost, capacity, and environmental or social impact. It could also help identify which neighborhoods or institutions should be prioritized for interventions to maximize total sustainability benefits within limited resources. Overall, the use of LP can ensure our environmental efforts are both effective and efficient."
